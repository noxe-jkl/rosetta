To Varik Thorne, Leader of the Vipers,

I trust this letter finds you in reasonable health, despite your less-than-impressive circumstances. It has come to my attention that your band of mercenaries is in need of a new assignment, and I have just the task to keep you occupied.

Your new objective is the town of Silverdale. You are to harry and harass the townsfolk, focusing your efforts on the carts entering the town. Your petty attacks will serve as a delightful distraction for the town's feeble law enforcement and any other would-be heroes who might interfere.

While your men are occupied with Silverdale, I will be executing a plan of far greater significance—the utter destruction of Stonebrook. The simplicity of your task should be well within your capabilities, even for one of your limited foresight.

Ensure that your actions are noisy and disruptive enough to draw attention. I require Silverdale's defenders to be fully engaged, unaware of the fate that awaits Stonebrook. Fail me in this, and you will find my wrath far less forgiving than your mundane rivals.

Do not disappoint me, Varik. Prove that you and your Vipers are at least competent in creating chaos.
